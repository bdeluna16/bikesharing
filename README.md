## Overview
In this module we were to build a business proposal for a potential investor for our bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. The data we used was sourced from bike sharing activity in New York City from 2019. Utilizing Tableu's visualization resources we built a story for the investor to prove that we could build a successful bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results
Below are the results of the analysis we ran on the 2019 bike sharing data in New York City:

1. Top Starting Locations - The heatmap below shows that the most popular starting locations for bike sharing is in central Manhattan.

# Summary
After analyzing the data we came up with the conclusions below:
1. The most popular starting locations for bike trips are in a city area, more so in the center of the city.
2. The peak usage hours occur during AM & PM commuting hours of the day.
3. Most bikes were checked out for no more than 5.5 hours.
4. Males & Females have similar behavior in regards to how long they check out bikes for.
5. Subscribers mostly use bike sharing for commuting to work while non subscribers use it for leisure having most of the activity occur on the weekend.
6. The peak hours on the weekend are from 10:00 AM - 7:00 PM.

Overall the trend that we saw was that bike sharing was a really effective way to commute to work. The demand for fast, convenient, and easy transportation in a big city is apparent and Des Moines could easily benefit from the same bike sharing business that New York has had success with. 
In order to dive in deeper with the analysis we could have also looked at peaked usage hours and determined when a good time for bike maintenace was. The hours that saw the least amount of activity would have been the optimal time to perform maintenance. We could have also looked at average trip duration by age. Looking at the age demographich in Des Moines, the data from the analysis would have helped us gauge how long we could expect each age group to rider for.
